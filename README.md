# chessAI
A simple chess AI console game. Uses minmax algorithm to make decisions. Not optimised yet.

Future planned updates:
-Adding opening moves and end games based on real database from player data to make game more realistic. 
-Optimising the minmax algorithm, currently takes 20-30 seconds to make decisions which is not optimal. 
-Addition of alpha/beta pruning. 
-Enabling difficulty adjustments.
